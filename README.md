## **HotelDB - Data and Applications**
<br>

### This is team project with each team containing 3 people

<br>

### In this project - we are able to manage a group of hotels and their customer's and manage few functinalities like book a hotel,checkout from a hotel,filters like with/without AC etc.,

<br>

### ***the main part of the project is Phase4 which has the DB with sample data(4.sql) and interactive python code(4.py) to work with it.***

### ***we also have a demo video explaining the functionalities - 4.mp4.***

<br>

<pre>
We can add more functionalities to this DB by adding the location and other details so that we can track all the Hotel's.
Thus the customer's can choose the nearest and best hotel.
So the HotelDB can implemented for a real-World "Set of Hotel's", if taken enough care about 'scalability'
</pre> 

### **We are open to collaborate and add more functionality to the code.**
